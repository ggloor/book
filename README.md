# book on Compositional Data Analysis of High Throughput Sequencing Datasets

This is a rough draft of a book that is intended to gather as much as I know on this topic. It will be used in graduate courses and workshops

There is much to be done, including code-checking and polishing. 

There are not many use examples. Check out the Macklaim 2013 paper for meta-transcriptomics, the Bian 2017 paper for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and the Gloor 2017 Frontiers paper for additional code.

Please send comments if you have them
