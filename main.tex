This booklet is intended for use in teaching graduate student courses
and conference workshops on using compositional data analysis methods to
examine high throughput sequencing datasets. The approach taken here is
largely intuitive and hands on. Formulas for basic methodologies are
presented, but the intuitive reason for using them takes precedence. The
methods presented here have been used for 16S rRNA gene sequencing,
transcriptomics, metagenomics and in-vitro selection (selex)
experiments.

I begin with background and theory, and progress to practical examples.
I hope you find this useful.

\section{The nature of sequencing
data}\label{the-nature-of-sequencing-data}

The human microbiome project has initiated the large-scale
culture-independent analysis of microbial communities, and transcriptome
analysis has led to the study of the transcriptional response to many
different disease and ecological states.

However, many studies fail to replicate earlier studies even when the
same technologies and strategies are used. As just one example, a
multitude of studies have examined the link between autism and the human
gut microbiota. These have variously implicated x,y,\ldots{},and z
microbe as being linked to the condition. In a recent high-profile paper
by Hsiao et al. (2013), \emph{Bacillus fragilis} was suggested to
restore the gut microbiome of a mouse autism model from `autistic-like'
to `normal'. Examination of the dataset shows that the conclusion was
likely due to chance alone (Gloor and Reid, 2016; Gloor et al., 2016).
While the autism dataset serves as a facile example, the literature are
replete with other examples.

\subsection{DNA sequencing describes a random sample of the
environment}\label{dna-sequencing-describes-a-random-sample-of-the-environment}

All high throughput gene sequencing datasets share a common origin and
it is important to understand the source of the data, and the standard
workflow. In the first step, an arbitrarily large population of DNA
molecules is randomly sampled from an environment. The random sampling
can be direct, in the case of genomics or metagenomics DNA is made
directly from the sample. Sampling can be indiredt in the case of
RNA-seq where RNA molecules are sampled after they have been converted
to DNA via reverse transcription. Regardless, the DNA molecules are
typically fragmented. Sampling can also be indirect in the case of
tag-sequencing or single cell sequencing. In tag-sequencing, most
typically applied to 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a small defined region is
amplified by the PCR. In single cell sequencing the molecules from a
single cell are fragmented and amplified.

In the second step, an aliquot of the population of DNA fragments are
used to make a library by attaching standard sequences that permit the
DNA fragments to be bound to the solid phase sequencing chip particular
to a particular platform.

In the third step a sample of the library is loaded onto a sequencing
platform. It is important to understand that all sequencing platforms in
widespread use contain a fixed number of locations to which the DNA
fragments can bind.

This standardized workflow can be thought of as three random samples
from an urn containing a random assortment of DNA fragments. The first
random sample is the sample from the environment itself that is used to
make the DNA: what is swabbed, and how much is collected relative to the
environment. Depending on the environment, the subset of molecules
sampled can be a large and complete sample or a small, incomplete and
unrepresentative sample. The second random sample is the subset of DNA
fragments that are input into the library preparation reaction. Here,
the number of fragments available depends on the initial amount of the
DNA, the mean fragment size and the requirements of the library
preparation protocol. However, all library preparation protocols
required more DNA fragments than can be loaded onto the instrument, an
example calculation is given below. The third random sample comprise the
subset of DNA fragments from the library that are actually sequenced on
the machine.

\subsubsection{Instrument capacity}\label{instrument-capacity}

The Ion Torrent and Ion Proton systems have a chip with a predetermined
number of pores on the sequencing chip (10 of thousands to 10s of
millions, depending on the chip) that can accept a library fragment. No
signal is returned from an empty pore, and the signal is rejected if a
pore contains two or more different fragments. Sequencing is successful
only when the pore is occupied by a single fragment from the library.

The Illumina sequencing instruments attach the DNA fragments to a glass
slide and then each fragment is amplified into millions of identical
fragments called clusters, which appear as randomly distributed spots
under a microscope. Each different Illumina instrument accommodates a
characteristic maximum number of clusters, and if two or more clusters
overlap they are rejected by the software.

Thus, regardless of instrument, the technician must apply a precise
number of DNA molecules that maximizes the number of fragments on the
sequencing instrument without overloading it. It should be obvious that
loading a DNA sequencer is akin to filling the squares on a checkerboard
where the goal is to have as many checkers as possible, without
overlapping the pieces.

\subsubsection{Example calculation of fragment
number}\label{example-calculation-of-fragment-number}

The number of fragments after sequencing is determined by the
instrument; an Ilumina MiSeq delivers \(\sim 20\)M fragments whereas an
Illumina NextSeq delivers \(\sim 400\)M and an Illumina HiSeq can
deliver \(\sim 250\)M reads per lane on each of 8 lanes. The commonly
used Nextera DNA library kit is optimized to require 50 ng of DNA per
sample. Thus, the number of fragments of DNA (or RNA) molecules in the
underlying environment, in general, vastly outnumbers the number of
sequence fragments from which the library is made, and the number of
fragments in the library in turn outnumbers the number of fragments from
which sequencing data are ultimately derived. We can do a simple back of
the envelope calculation for an example metagenomics sequencing run to
show this.

Assume that we have a mixture of bacterial species with a mean genome
size of 4 Mb. One mole of genomes would have a mass of
\(2.64 \times 10^9\) grams. A typical bacterial density for a metagenome
would be on the order of at least \(10^7\) bacteria per ml of sample, so
if we take a 1 ml sample, this is \(10^7\) genomes, which corresponds to
about 44 ng of DNA.

If the DNA concentration after isolation is 1 ng\(/ \mu\)l, and one
\(\mu\)l of DNA is taken, this corresponds to
(\(1\times 10^{-9} \mathrm{\ g}) / (2.64 \times 10^9\ \mathrm{g/mole}) \times (6.02 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{\ genomes/mole}) = 228,000\)
genomes. The Illumina Nextera XT kit can be used to make a library with
this amount of DNA. Recall that the the DNA is fragmented, typically
into 500 bp or smaller sizes. Using a fragment size of 500 bp, this
corresponds to approximately \(1.8 \times 10^9\) DNA fragments.

In the scenario where a single sample is prepared and run only 1\% of
DNA fragments in the library will be sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq,
and only 22\% of the DNA fragmments will be sequenced on the Illumina
NextSeq. DNA sequencing rarely involves a single sample, but instead
samples are `multiplexed' on the sequencing run by mixing two or more
libraries together. When this occurs the samples have a unique tag, or
barcode, attached so that the samples can be uniquely identified post
sequencing (Andersson et al., 2008; Gloor et al., 2010; Parameswaran et
al., 2007). Barcodes can be added by ligation or by incorporation into
PCR primers that are used to amplify the library. Obviously, increasing
the number of samples through multiplexing will result in an even
smaller proportion of the fragments in each library being sequenced.

\subsection{DNA sequencing is not
counting}\label{dna-sequencing-is-not-counting}

From the above, it should be clear that DNA sequencing is not a counting
operation but is instead a random sampling operation from a large pool,
akin to sampling different colored balls from an urn containing more
balls than are sampled. A counting operation always allows the addition
of `one more observation'. In the context of DNA sequencing this would
equate to loading the samples onto an Illumina MiSeq chip to the optimal
fragment density and then adding in `one more fragment' repeatedly until
the number of fragments loaded exceed the capacity of the chip. The
sequencing reaction will fail when the number of frangments exceeds the
chip capacity. Stated bluntly, one cannot purchase an Illumina MiSeq run
and expect to receive data equivalent to an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq
run. This self-evident fact is completely overlooked in the literature.

If the number of DNA fragments sequenced is has an arbitrary upper bound
determined by the machine, and the number of fragments in the library is
always larger than the machine capacity, then it should be obvious that
the number of fragments sequenced can contain no information about the
\emph{number} of fragments in the library pool, nor can the number of
fragments contain information about the \emph{number} of molecules in
the original DNA sample from the environment. The univariate logical
equivalent is to only know the percentage that a suit is marked down to,
without knowing the original price. The multivariate intuition is that
we cannot know the number of balls of different colour in the urn, we
can only infer their proportions.

Therefore, the only information available is the \emph{relative}
proportion of individual fragments in the library, which is assumed to
approximate the proportion of fragments in the DNA sample from the
environment.We will revisit this issue when we discuss normalizations in
common use.

\subsection{Random processes in
sequencing}\label{random-processes-in-sequencing}

The random sampling process in DNA sequencing has at least three
overlapping stochastic processes; environmental sampling, fragment
sampling and multiplex sampling.

Sampling from the environment is random since the investigator never
collects all the DNA samples from an environment, but rather collects a
small aliquot from a specific time or place in the environment. Only the
DNA molecules actually collected are used to make the DNA library, and
these molecules are assumed to be representative of the environment.
Note that this assumption may not always be true. For example, it has
been observed that different microbial compositions are observed when
collecting stool samples if a sample is taken from the interior or
exterior of the stool (Gorzelak et al., 2015).

Fragment sampling occurs because as noted above the fragments actually
sequenced are a random sample of the fragments that are in the
sequencing library. There are always more fragments in the library than
can be accommodated on the instrument, and there are almost always more
molecules in the environment than can be accommodated in the library.
The sole exception to this rule would be when sequencing is used to
investigate low biomass environments---however in this case the library
protocols always have an amplification step that increases the number of
fragments above the number that can be accommodated on the instrument.
The fragment sampling occurs by a multivariate Poisson process
(Fernandes et al., 2013).

Two or more independent libraries are mixed together into a multiplex
library, and this adds a third level of randomness into the process. The
number of fragments in each library is one of the strongest influences
on the apparent information in the sample (Horner-Devine et al., 2004;
Weiss et al., 2017). The number of fragments observed post sequencing is
termed the
\texttt{library\ size\textquotesingle{}\ or\ the\ \textquotesingle{}}`depth
of coverage'. In other words, the number of fragments identified in a
sample post sequencing is a confounding variable.

The apparent solution to the sequencing depth problem is to normalize
the read count values across samples in some way. One method of
normalization to is by subsampling, often termed rarefaction, as this is
observed to reduce the influence of sequencing depth on variation in
\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) diversity metrics (Horner-Devine et al., 2004;
Weiss et al., 2017). Another is to convert the data to proportions or
percentages; these latter values are widely spoken of in the literature
as `relative abundances'. Subsampling is frequently used to estimate the
associated sampling error. Some groups have begun advocating the use of
normalization methods prevalent in the RNA-seq field(McMurdie and
Holmes, 2014) but still treat the data as point estimates of the true
abundance. There are many other normalizations that are used in the
ecological and high throughput sequencing literature and the purpose and
effect of these on simulated data are explored in the section on Data
Transformations.

\section{DNA sequencing data are
compositions}\label{dna-sequencing-data-are-compositions}

\subsection{Compositional data analysis: more formal
statement.}\label{compositional-data-analysis-more-formal-statement.}

A dataset is defined as compositional if it contains \(D\) multiple
parts, where each part is non-negative, and the sum of the parts is
known (Aitchison, 1986,pg25). A composition containing \(D\) parts where
the sum is 1 can be formally stated as:
\(C_D = \{(x_1,x_2,x_3, \ldots x_D); x_1\ge 0, x_2\ge 0, x_3 \ge 0, \ldots x_D \ge 0; \sum_{x=1}^{D} = 1\}\).
The sum of the parts is usually set to 1 or 100, but can take any value;
i.e., any composition can be scaled to any arbitrary sum such as a ppm.
It is important to know that the values of the parts of compositional
datasets are constrained because of the constant sum. The constant sum
constraint causes the parts to have a negative correlation bias since an
increase in the value of one part must be offset by a decrease in value
of one or more other parts. Thus any correlation-based analysis is
invalid in these datasets, as originally noted by Pearson(1897). In
addition, compositional datasets have the property that they are
described by \(D-1\) observations if the sum of the parts is known
(Aitchison, 1986). In other words, if we know that all parts sum to 1,
then the last part can be known by subtracting the sum of all other
parts from 1, i.e., \(x_D = 1-\sum_{x=1}^{D-1}\). Graphically, this
means that compositions inhabit a space called the Aitchison simplex
that contains 1 fewer dimensions than the number of parts. The distances
between parts on the Aitchison simplex are not linear, especially at the
boundaries. This is important because all common statistical tests
assume a that differences between parts are linear (or additive). Thus,
while standard tests will produce output, the output will be misleading
because distances on the simplex are non-linear and
bounded(MartÃ­n-FernÃ¡ndez et al., 1998).

\subsubsection{Sub-compositions:}

\textasciitilde{}Compositional data also exhibit the unusual property
that the examination of a sub-composition of these data will provide
different answers for those taxa in common in the full and
sub-composition (Aitchison, 1986). This is problematic because 16S rRNA
gene sequencing experimental designs are \emph{always} sub-compositions.
Inspection of papers in the literature provide many examples. For
example, it is common practice to discard rare OTU species prior to
analysis and to re-normalize by dividing the counts for the remaining
OTUs by the new sample sum. It is also common to use only one or a few
taxonomic groupings to determine differences between experimental
conditions. In the case of RNA-seq only the mRNA or miRNA is sequenced.
All of these practices expose the investigator to the problem of
non-coherence between sub-compositions. Formally, the approach used here
is not sub-compositionally coherent, but it is a reasonable
approximation as long as the majority of OTUs are invariant or exhibit
stochastic fluctuations.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{main_files/figure-latex/R_block_correlation-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{correlation} Spurious correlation in compositional data.
Two random vectors drawn from a Normal distribution, were divided by a
third vector also drawn at random from a Normal distribution. The two
vectors have nothing in common, they should exhibit no correlation, and
yet they exhibit a correlation coefficent of \(>0.65\) when divided by
the third vector. See the introductory section of the Supplementary
Information of Lovell (2015) for a more complete description of this
phenomenon.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spurious correlations:}\label{spurious-correlations}

Finally, it is important to know that compositional data has the
additional problem of spurious correlation (Pearson, 1897), and in fact
this was the first troubling issue identified with compositional data.
This phenomenon is best illustrated with the following example from
Lovell et. al (2015), where they show how simply dividing two sets of
random numbers (say abundances of OTU1 and OTU2), by a third set of
random numbers (say abundances of OTU3) results in a strong correlation.
Note that this phenomenon depends only on there being a common
denominator.

Practically speaking this means that
\emph{every microbial correlation network that has ever been published is suspect}
unless it was determined using SPARCC \cite{Friedman:2012} or SPIEC-EASI
(Kurtz et al., 2015) or the \(\phi\) metric (Lovell et al., 2015). These
approaches themselves have limitations, both SPARCC and SPIEC-EASI
assume sparse data, and the \(\phi\) metric as originally constituted
cannot deal with sparse data. Lovell is in the process of producing an R
package for the compositionally appropriate examination of correlations
(personal communication), and below we show one strategy by which the
\(\phi\) metric can be adapted to sparse data.

Atichison (1986), Pawlsky-Glahn (2006), and Egozcue (2005), have done
much work to develop rigorous approaches to analyze compositional data
(Pawlowsky-Glahn and Buccianti, 2011). The essential step is to reduce
the data to ratios between the \(D\) parts as outlined above. This step
does not move the data from the Simplex but does transform the data on
the Simplex such that the distances between the ratios of the features
are linear. The investigator must keep in mind that the distances are
between ratios, not between counts. Several transformations are in
common use, but the one most applicable to HTS data is the centred
log-ratio transformation or clr, where the data in each sample is
transformed by taking the logarithm of the the ratio between the count
value for each part and the geometric mean count: i.e., for D features
in sample X:

\(clr [x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots x_D] = [log_2(x_1/gX), log_2(x_2/gX), log_2(x_3/gX) \ldots log_2(x_D/gX)]\),

where \(gX\) is the geometric mean of the features in sample X. This is
the transformation described above.

\subsection{So how can I analyze compositional
data?}\label{so-how-can-i-analyze-compositional-data}

Fortunately, the analysis of compositional datasets has a well-developed
methodology (Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015; Van den Boogaart and
Tolosana-Delgado, 2013), much of which was worked out in the geological
sciences. The following steps, and example code, is a step by step guide
to examining a compositional 16S rRNA gene sequencing dataset in a
compositional manner. This approach assumes that there is nothing really
special about high-throughput sequencing data from the point of view of
the analysis. The user should realize however that compositional data
analysis is still an area of active research and the types of datasets
typically found in high-throughput biology are particularly problematic
because they are high-dimensional datasets that contain many 0 values.

There are three main data analysis issues that must be acknowledged.

First, the nature of these data are misunderstood. As outlined above,
the number of counts observed per OTU are determined entirely by the
capacity of the instrument and provide no information about the number
of molecules in the input sample. Recall that both bacterial growth, and
PCR are doubling processes and not linear processes, and so would be
better modelled as log\(_2\) differences.

Understanding that we are dealing with fold-change data is an explicit
acknowledgement that the data do not map to normal Euclidian space where
differences are linear. Commonly used statistical tests expect linear
differences between values and so are compromised to some degree, often
catastrophically(Aitchison, 1986,vandenBoogaart2008320) Therefore, the
often-used approaches of converting the OTU count values to proportions
or percentages and conducting statistical tests on those values, or of
using data reduction strategies such as Principle Component Analysis on
the values are inappropriate because the differences between values are
not linear. An alternative approach is to convert the OTU counts to
ratios(Aitchison, 1986; Aitchison and J. Egozcue, 2005; Pawlowsky-Glahn
and Buccianti, 2011; Pawlowsky-Glahn and Egozcue, 2006) which makes the
differences between the ratios of values linear, and so allows the use
of common statistical tests.

However the user must interpret the output as ratios between feature
abundances rather than absolute differences(Pawlowsky-Glahn and
Buccianti, 2011) This approach is described below.

Second, high throughput sequencing (HTS) data represent samples of an
unknown underlying large number of molecules. Thus, there is a large and
unappreciated error of estimation that is problematic when dealing with
these data(Fernandes et al., 2013) The high error of estimation often
results in false positive identification of differences, in fact, the
statistical result can often be explained entirely by sampling
variation. This error is not captured by rarefaction or even
acknowledged by other normalization methods and should be estimated and
accounted for when deciding what is a significant difference.

Third, 16S rRNA gene sequencing surveys, and similar experiments,
contain many variables in each sample. Thus, any analysis that attempts
to characterize the individual differences between groups must correct
for the many hypotheses that are being tested. This step is often
ignored, even in work published in very high profile journals subject to
rigorous peer review.

The purpose of these notes is to show why HTS data for 16S rRNA gene
sequencing, and any similar experiments such as RNA-seq, should be
treated as ratio data and that it is possible to do so simply. We show
that this approach accurately recapitulates the shape of the data for
both constrained and unconstrained datasets. We show that converting the
data to ratios can accurately model the very high variability at the low
count margins, and that rarefaction under-estimates this variability. We
use an example from the literature to show how ignoring these factors
leads to improper conclusions. \clearpage

\section{Data transforms in high throughput
sequencing}\label{data-transforms-in-high-throughput-sequencing}

\subsection{Sequencing can change the shape of the
data:}\label{sequencing-can-change-the-shape-of-the-data}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{main_files/figure-latex/R_block_constrained_data-1.pdf}
\caption{\label=\{constant\} High-throughput sequencing affects the
shape of the data differently on constrained and unconstrained data. The
two left panels show the absolute number of reads in the input tube for
20 steps where the green and black OTUs are changing abundance by 2-fold
each step. The gray, blue and red OTUs are held at a constant number in
each step in both cases. The second column shows the output in
proportions (or ppm, or FPKM) after random sampling to a constant sum,
as occurs on the sequencer. The orange OTU in the constrained data set
is much more abundant than any other, and is changing to maintain a
constant number of input molecules. Samples in the two right columns are
the same values plotted on a log scale on the Y-axis for convenience.
Note how the constrained data is the same before and after sequencing
while the unconstrained data is severely distorted.}
\end{figure}

It is assumed that the output from a high-throughput sequencing
experiment represents in some way the underlying abundance of the input
DNA molecules. The input counts panels on the left side of Figure
\ref{constant} shows two idealized experiments. The top left shows the
case where the total count of all nucleic acid species in the input is
constrained, the bottom left illustrates the case where the total count
is unconstrained. These are modelled as a time series, but any process
would produce the same results.

Constrained datasets occur if the increase or decrease in any component
is exactly compensated by the increase or decrease of one or more
others. Here the total count remains constant across all experimental
conditions. Examples of constrained datasets would include allele
frequencies at a locus where the total has to be 1, and the RNA-seq
where the induction of genes occurs in a steady-state cell culture. In
this case, any process, such as sequencing that generates a proportion
simply recapitulates the data with sampling error. The unspoken
assumption in most high throughput experimental designs is that this
assumption is true---\emph{ it is not!}

An unconstrained dataset results if the total count is free to vary.
Examples of unconstrained datasets would include ChIP-Seq, RNA-seq where
we are examining two different conditions or cell populations,
metagenomics, etc. Importantly, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses are
almost always free to vary; that is, the total bacterial load is rarely
constant in an environment. Thus, the unconstrained data type would be
the predominant type of data that would be expected.

The relative abundance panels on the right side of Figure \ref{constant}
shows the result of random sampling with a defined maximum value in
these two types of datasets. This random sampling reflects the data that
results from high throughput sequencing where the total number of reads
is constrained by the instrument capacity. The data is represented as a
proportion, but scales to parts per million or parts per billion without
changing the shape. Here we see that the shape of the data after
sequencing is very similar to the input data in the case of constrained,
but is very different in the case of non-constrained data. In the
unconstrained dataset, observe how the blue and red features appear to
be constant over the first 10 time points, but then appear to decrease
in abundance at later time points. Conversely, the black feature appears
to increase linearly at early time points, but appears to become
constant at late time points. Obviously, we would misinterpret what is
happening if we compared early and late timepoints in the unconstrained
dataset. It is also worth noting how the act of random sampling makes
the proportional abundance of the rare OTU species uncertain in both the
constrained and unconstrained data, but has little effect on the
relative apparent effect on the relative abundance of OTUs with high
counts.

We assume that the abundance of each input DNA species that is observed
after sequencing reflects a random sample of the input molecules. We can
see that that this may indeed be the case if the total number of
molecules in the input sample is constant. This constraint would be met
if, for example, an increase in one or more DNA species was balanced
with an equivalent decrease in one or more different species. Such a
constraint would be met In the figure, the red and blue OTU sequences
are held constant in each sample, the green OTU is decreasing by 2 fold
and the black OTU is increasing by 2 fold in each subsequent sample. The
abundance of the orange OTU is adjusted such that the total sum of the
OTU sequences in the input is held constant. Here it can be seen that
the input counts and the relative abundance of each species following
sequence have similar shapes, with the exception that the rarest species
display significant variability because of random sampling.

\subsection{Commonly used transformations are
misleading}\label{commonly-used-transformations-are-misleading}

Current practice is to examine the datasets using `relative abundance'
values, that is, the proportional abundance of the OTUs either before or
after normalization for read depth. This approach is equivalent to
examining the input unconstrained data of the type seen in Figure
\ref{constant} in the relative abundance sample space in the bottom
right panel of the figure. This approach will obviously lead to
incorrect assumptions in at least some cases. For example, depending
upon the steps chosen to compare, the blue OTU, that has constant counts
in the input, will be seen to either increase or decrease in abundance.
Conversely, the green OTU, that is always decreasing in abundance will
be seen to be constant if comparing samples 1-8.

The ecological literature offers many different transformations for such
data, often as a way of making the data appear `more normal'. Figure
\ref{transform} shows the results of five such transformations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The frequency transform divides the each OTU value by the largest OTU
  count, and then divides the resulting values by the number of OTUs in
  the sample that had non-zero counts.
\item
  The Hellinger transformation that takes the square root of the
  relative abundance (proportion) value.
\item
  The range transform standardizes the values to have a range from 0 to
  1. OTUs with 0 counts are set to 0.
\item
  The standardize transform standardizes the values for each sample to
  have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
\item
  The log transform divides each OTU count in a sample by the minimum
  non-zero count value, then takes the logarithm of the resulting value
  and adds 1. Counts of 0 are assigned a value of 0 to avoid taking the
  logarithm of 0.
\item
  The centred log-ratio transformation divides the OTU values by the
  geometric mean OTU abundance, and then takes the logarithm.
\end{itemize}

It is obvious that the first four transformations result in data that
badly mis-represents the shape of the actual input data. The log
transformation, however results in the shape of the output data
approximating the shape of the input data, except that the uncertainty
of each data point is large. The ratio transform his transformation
accurately recapitulates the shape of the original input data, and more
accurately represents the uncertainty of each data point.

\caption{\label{transforms} The effect of ecological transformations on
unconstrained high throughput sequencing datasets. Data generated as in

\end{figure}

Fundamentally, the goal of any experiment is to determine something
about the environment that was sampled. After all, we are attempting to
use HTS to determine something of interest about the underlying
environment. Thus, we need to have some equivalence between the samples
before sequencing and the samples after sequencing. The simplest case
would be that there would be a linear relationship between the data that
we could obtain from the environment, and the data that was actually
collected by HTS.

We can think about the underlying data on a univariate basis; do the
features across all samples follow a Gaussian distribution? or do they
follow some unknown distribution? If so, can we transform the data to
approximate a Gaussian distribution? This mode of thinking leads to the
use of square-root, arcsine or Hellinger transformations since they
appear to transform the data into a distribution that can be
interpreted. However, as we shall see below, none of these univariate
transformations is suitable.

It is more desirable to think about HTS data in a multivariate way as a
`composition' because the total count of molecules in the underlying
sample (the environment) is always a confounding variable (LovÃ©n et al.,
2012). This way of thinking led to multivariate data normalizations.

We will set up a random dataset, composed of four features (T, L, G, A)
and 50 random samples with mean values of 100 tigers, 10000 ladybugs,
1000 gnus and 5 space aliens. The features will be drawn from a Normal
distibution, although a random uniform distribution or any other
distribution will give the same results. We are not, at this point,
attempting to mimic a distribution found in a real dataset, but are
instead showing the general properties of the distance metrics, and how
those metrics compare when calculated on numerical data, obtained as
counts in the environment, or on proportional data, obtained as relative
abundances after sequencing.

and Aliens vs.~Gnus for simulated random Normal data.}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{numbers} shows the relationships between three features in
the actual dataset. We can see that the features are randomly normally
distributed and uncorrelated in the scatter plots. Most tools attempt to
infer something about this numerical dataset. For this to work, the data
transforms must be linearly related in some way to this underlying data.

Let us see which, if any of the transforms fulfills this basic
requirement.

\subsection{Notation}\label{notation}

We use the following notation throughout. Column vectors contain samples
\(\vec{\textbf{s}}\) and row vectors contain features
\(\vec{\textbf{f}}\). There are \(D\) features and \(n\) samples, thus
the data are contained in matrix \(M = D \times n\). The \(j^{th}\)
sample is denoted as \(s_{j}\), the \(i^{th}\) feature of all samples is
denoted as \(s_{i-}\), and the value for the \(i^{th}\) feature of the
\(j^{th}\) sample is referred to as \(s_{ij}\).

\subsection{Simple proportional type
transformations}\label{simple-proportional-type-transformations}

The simplest normalization is to determine the relative abundance (rAB),
or proportion, of the \ith{i} feature in a sample as in Eq.
\ref{eq:rab}. This normalization is also referred to as the total sum
scaling (TSS) normalization.

\begin{equation}
    rAB_{i} = \frac{s_{i}}{\sum{\vec{\textbf{s}}}}
    \label{eq:rab}
\end{equation}

The rAB measure requires only the read count observed for a the feature
\(s_i\) and the total read count of the sample
\(\sum{\vec{\textbf{s}}}\). Since this measure is generally skewed, it
is often log-transformed prior to analysis.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{main_files/figure-latex/R_block_TSS-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{numbers} Plot of Ladybugs vs.~Tigers, Gnus vs.~Ladybugs
and Aliens vs.~Gnus for simulated random Normal data as proportions.}
\end{figure}

By comparing the proportions to the non-transformed data, we can see
that the structure of the data itself has changed dramatically. The two
most abundant features, G and L, which are uncorrelated in the actual
data are now almost perfectly negatively correlated when the same data
are converted and plotted as proportions, G.p vs L.p.~This is because
the data are now not real numbers, but are instead proportions and are
constrained by the arbitrary sum of 1:
\emph{the data are now compositional data}.

A further normalization was proposed early in the RNA-seq field where
the reads per kilobase per million mapped (RPKM)(Mortazavi et al., 2008)
method was used initially to place the read counts for each feature
within and between samples on a common scale.

For this we also needed to know a scaling factor \(K\), and the length
of the feature \(L_i\); from this, the RPKM value for the \ith{i}
feature for each sample was calculated as in Eq. \ref{eq:rpkm}.

\begin{equation}
    RPKM_{i} = \frac{K \cdot C_{i} }{\sum{C} \cdot L_{i}}
    \label{eq:rpkm}
\end{equation}

When the equation is placed in this form it is obvious that RPKM is
simply a scaled rAB where each rAB value is divided by its length and
multiplied by a constant. In compositional terms, RPKM is an unclosed
perturbation of the original data; the data appear to be real numbers,
but are actually proportions multiplied by a constant.

Further research suggested that RPKM was not appropriate for comparison
of features between samples. The goal of RPKM was to `count' reads per
feature per cell. In the original paper the authors supplied an
equivalence and an RPKM value of 1 RPKM equalled one transcript in each
cell in the C2C12 cell line, but in liver cells, a value of 3 RPKM
equalled one transcript per cell. Thus, from the start, this
normalization was unable to normalize between-condition read counts.

The transcripts per million (TPM) normalization was advocated next (Li
et al., 2010). Patcher (Pachter, 2011) showed the equivalence between
RPKM and TPM, and in compositional terms TPM is simply a compositionally
closed form of RPKM multiple by a constant as in Eq. \ref{eq:tpm}.

\begin{equation}
    TPM_{i} = \frac{RPKM_i}{\sum{RPKM}} \cdot K
    \label{eq:tpm}
\end{equation}

The rAB, RPKM and TPM normalizations are thus all very similar,
differing only in the scaling of individual features, and do not allow
normalization between conditions unless the samples in the environment
contain \emph{exactly} the same input number of RNA molecules. In a very
real sense, these normalizations deliver proportional data, scaled or
perturbed to make the data appear as if they are numerical, and not
proportional.

A related transformation is `rarefaction' or subsampling without
replacement to a defined per-sample read count. This transformation was
widely used in the 16S rRNA gene sequencing field. Rarefaction to a
common read count gives a composition, that is scaled such that low
count features often are replaced by 0 values (McMurdie and Holmes,
2014). For this reason, rarefaction has now been largely replaced with
the median of ratios method described below.

\subsection{The median of ratios count
normalization}\label{the-median-of-ratios-count-normalization}

Further work found that none of these methods were appropriate, since
the read count per sample continued to confound the analyses (LovÃ©n et
al., 2012). Thus, the scaling normalization methods were proposed
(Robinson and Oshlack, 2010). There are two main scaling normalizations,
but both operate on the common assumption that by normalizing all counts
in a sample to a per-sample midpoint value the normalization can impute
the \emph{number} of each feature in the environment. The approaches
differ largely in how the midpoint is determined. The median of ratios
method (MR) is instantiated in DESeq2 (and others), and the trimmed mean
of M values (TMM) method is used by edgeR (and others). The DM method
will be demonstrated and used, but the TMM gives substantially similar
results, and uses the same basic logic since sample values are scaled by
a per-sample feature-wise midpoint.

The DM method calculates the ratio of the features to the geometric
mean, \(\mathrm{G}_i\), of each feature across all samples, and then
takes as the normalization factor the median ratio per sample as the
scaling factor. Each feature is then divided by the scaling factor to
place each sample on an
\texttt{equivalent\textquotesingle{}\ count\ scale.\ The\ idea\ is\ that\ the\ DM\ normalization}opens'
the data from being compositional to being scaled counts. It is
impossible to open the data, and while the scaled counts may have some
useful properties, removing compositional constraints are not among
them.

The multi-step normalization MR normalization attempts to normalize for
sequencing depth thus `opening' the data, and proceeeds as in the
multistep Eq. \ref{eq:dm}. Here we start with two sample vectors
\(\vec{\textbf{s}}_1\) and \(\vec{\textbf{s}}_2\), and calculate a
vector of geometric means of the features \(\vec{\textbf{g}}\). Ratio
vectors, \(\vec{\textbf{r}}_j\) are calculated by dividing the sample
vectors by the geometric mean vector, and the median of the ratio
vectors is determined. Finally, the sample vectors are divided by the
median of the ratio vector for each sample.

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \vec{\textbf{g}} = &\ \mathrm{G}_{i-}\\
        \vec{\textbf{r}}_j = &\ \vec{\textbf{s}}_j / \vec{\textbf{g}}\\
        \vec{\textbf{d}}_j = &\ \vec{\textbf{s}}_j / Md(\vec{\textbf{r}}_j)\\
    \end{aligned}
\label{eq:dm}
\end{equation}

In Table \ref{tab:des} we can see that the median ratio for each sample
\(\vec{\textbf{r}}_j\) samples may be different in each sample, and that
the particular feature that is the median may itself be different, the
median feature is in boldface in the table. Thus, by construction the
feature values in each sample can be scaled by different amounts in each
sample.

This DM transformation at first glance \emph{appears} to fix the problem
caused by converting the data from numbers to proportions. The pairs of
points in the top row are no longer as strongly correlated and the data
seem to be randomly distributed. However, plotting the actual numbers vs
the DM transformed values shows that the DM transformation is not
restoring the data to their original form, but to some other. In the
absence of a solid theoretical foundation, it is difficult to say
exactly how we should interpret these DM-transformed data. It should be
pointed out that above plots were generated on the TSS-normalized
dataset, however only the scale of the \emph{dm} axes would change if
the DM normalization was conducted on the original numerical data. Thus,
conclusions derived from data that are DM-normalized actually tell us
little about the underlying enviroment---despite the pervasive use of
this transformation in the biomedical literature.

\subsection{Log-ratio transformations}\label{log-ratio-transformations}

Aitchison (1986) introduced the concept of the log-ratio transformation.

There are three main log-ratio transformations; the additive log-ratio
(alr), centred log-ratio (clr) and the isometric log-ratio (ilr)
(Aitchison, 1986; Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015).

Using the same notation as above for a sample vector
\(\vec{\textbf{s}}\) of \(D\) `counted' features (taxa, operational
taxonomic units or OTUs, genes, etc.)
\(\vec{\textbf{s}}=[s_1, s_2, ... s_D]\):

The alr is the simply the elements of the sample vector divided by a
presumed invariant feature, which by convention here is the last one:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
 \vec{\textbf{x}}_{alr}= &\ [log(x_1/x_D), log(x_2/x_D), \\
 & \ldots log(x_D-1/x_D]
\end{aligned}
 \label{eq:alr}
\end{equation}

This is similar to the concept used in quantitative PCR, where the
relative abundance of the feature of interest is divided by the relative
abundance of a (presumed) constant `housekeeping' feature. Of course
there are two major drawbacks. First, that the experimentalist's
knowledge of which, if any, features are invariant is necessarily
incomplete. Second, is that the choice of the (presumed) invariant
feature has a large effect on the result if the presumed invariant
feature is not invariant, or if it is correlated with any other features
in the dataset. Interestingly, an early proposal was to use the
geometric mean of a number of internal controls (Vandesompele et al.,
2002), leading to the next transformation.

The centered log-ratio (clr) transformation introduced by (Aitchison,
1983, 1986) uses the geometric mean of all features as the denominator:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
   \vec{\textbf{x}}_{clr} = & [log(x_1/\mathrm{G}(\vec{\textbf{x}})), \\
   & log(x_2/\mathrm{G}(\vec{\textbf{x}})), \\
   & \ldots log(x_D/\mathrm{G}(\vec{\textbf{x}}))]
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:clr}
\end{equation}

where
\(\mathrm{G}(\vec{\textbf{x}}) = \sqrt[D]{x_1 \cdot x_2 \cdot ... \cdot x_D}\),
the geometric mean of \(\vec{\textbf{x}}\).

The clr is often criticized since it has the property that the sum of
the clr vector must equal 0. This constraint causes a singular
covariance matrix; i.e., the sum of the covariance matrix is always a
constant (Pawlowsky-Glahn et al., 2015). However the clr has the
advantage of being readily interpretable, a value in the vector is its
abundance \emph{relative} to a mean value.

The ilr is the final transformation, and is a series of sequential
log-ratios between two groups of features. For example, the philr
transformation is the series of ratios between OTUs partitioned along
the phylogenetic tree (Silverman et al., 2017), although any other
sequential binary partitioning scheme is also possible (Pawlowsky-Glahn
et al., 2015). The ilr transformation does not suffer the drawbacks of
either the alr or clr, but does not allow for insights into
relationships between single features in the dataset. Nevertheless, ilr
transformations permit the full-range of multivariate tools to be used,
and are recommended whenever possible.

The ilr and clr are directly comparable in a two important ways: First,
the distances between samples computed using an ilr and clr
transformation are equivalent. Second, the clr approaches the ilr in
other respects as the number of features becomes large. In this respect,
the large number of features---hundreds in the case of OTUs, thousands
in the case of genes---in a typical experiment works in our favour.
Thus, while not perfect, the clr is the most widely used transformation.
However, care must be taken when interpreting its outputs since single
features must always be interpreted as a ratio between the feature and
the denominator used for the clr transformation. The problems of using
clr are apparent when some subcomposition or group of taxa is analysed
for further insight since the geometric mean of the subcomposition is
not necessarily equal to that of the original composition, leading to
potential inconsistencies.

Log-ratio values of any type do not need to be normalized since the
total sum is a term in both the numerator and the denominator. Thus, the
same log-ratio value will be obtained for the vector of raw read counts,
or the vector of normalized read counts, or the vector of proportions
calculated from the counts. Thus, log-ratios are said to be equivalence
classes such that there is no information in the total count (aside from
precision) (BarcelÃ³-Vidal et al., 2001).

Attempts to `open' the data are doomed to failure because the data
cannot be moved from the simplex to Euclidian space. The total count
delivered by the sequencing instrument is a function of the instrument
and not the number of molecules sampled from the environment, thus the
total count has no geometric meaning. If the data are collected in such
a way that the total count represents the actual count in the
environment, then the data are not compositional and issues regarding
compositional data disappear. However, at present all sequencing
platforms deliver a fixed-sum, random sample of the proportion of
molecules in the environment.

Note that this does not mean that the read depth is irrelevant since
more reads for a sample translate into greater precision when estimating
the proportions (Fernandes et al., 2013).

\section{Comparing Transforms and Distances}

The microbiome and transcriptome literature are replete with distance
metrics, and it is common to find that a single study will use several
distance metrics to report their findings. This is a problem since it
shows that practitioners are unsure of the reason to use a metric, and
the use of more than one metric leads to data dredging and research
degrees of freedom---both of which increase the chances of finding false
positives in the data to a surety.

Distance metrics can be broadly divided into those that require
partitioning and those that do not. The UniFrac (Lozupone and Knight,
2005; Lozupone et al., 2011) and philr (Silverman et al., 2017) both
require a phylogenetic tree, making these metrics applicable only to
situations where the features can be so partitioned. For example, these
distances are useful when examining 16S rRNA gene sequencing
experiments. We have found that the unweighted UniFrac method is
unreliable, and should be used with caution {[}Wong et al. (2016)\}, a
point that was made in the original UniFrac paper and subsequently
forgotten. The philr metric is a drop-in replacement for the weighted
UniFrac distance metric and should be used whenever possible, since
\texttt{philr} is an ilr transformation of the data where the sequential
binary partitions are made along the phylogenetic tree. The
\texttt{philr} transformation is thus compositionally appropriate. In
practice, the weighted UniFrac distance metric provides similar results
to the Aitchison distance, described below, and the ilr distance
calculated using the philr transform approaches the Aitchison distance
when the number of features is large.

Several non-phylogenetic distances are in widespread use in the
literature. These will be discussed in turn below, and their effects on
distances between a random samples illustrated.

\subsection{Distances in counts and proportion}

Ideally, we use distance metrics to inform us as to something of
relevance in the actual sample. That is, if we collect our data on the
numbers of tigers, ladybugs, gnus and space aliens, what can we infer
about the actual data \emph{after  sequencing}? which as we have seen,
is the same as asking what can we infer after converting the data to
relative abundances (proportions)?

There are two main ways to think about distances: Euclidian and
Manhattan. The Euclidian distance is the straight-line distance between
two points. If we have a rectangular room, the Euclidian distance
between two corners would be the distance travelled by walking
diagonally across the room from one corner to the other. The Manhattan
distance would be the distance travelled by walking along the walls
between the two corners. Obviously, the Manhattan distance will always
be larger than the Euclidian distance. So how do these two simple
metrics compare when calculate on numbers and on compositions?

We can see that the Euclidian and Manhattan distances are generally
correlated, but not identical, when comparing distances in the original
set of random samples only, or when the data in the samples are
converted to proportions. However, the distances between samples are
very different when comparing the numerical and proportional data. This
tells us that the inferences we make from sequencing data can not
translate to inferences about the actual abundances of features in the
environment, but only to their relative abundances. So which distance
metric should we use for proportional data? It turns out that neither
are suitable because these distance metrics assume linear differences
between features, and this is not true in proportional data (Aitchison,
1986).

Data normalizations are often touted as removing the compositionality of
the data. We shall see that this is not true, and inappropriate data
transformations confound, rather than providing clarity.

Plotting three of the possible combinations, we can see that the
features are essentially uncorrelated with each other and each sample is
a random distances from any other. Any inference we make from
transformations of this data must be relatable to this `ground truth'. I
now run through each of the transformations in turn, and illustrate the
difference between the actual data, and the transformed data.

\subsection{Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity}

The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity is a Manhattan distance normalized to
range between 0 and 1. In the test dataset, the Euclidian distance and
the Bray-Curtis (BC) distances are essentially linearly related.
